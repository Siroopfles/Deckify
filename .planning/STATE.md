## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v0.4 Phase 1]: Decoupled monoliths into `src/components/tabs/` and `py_modules/` submodules.
- [v0.4 Phase 2]: Concurrency-throttled base64 image queue with LRU cache bypassing Steam CEF CSP.
- [v0.4 Phase 3]: Monotonic clock ticker (`usePlaybackClock`) with drift gating and post-seek suppression.
- [v0.4 Phase 4]: Sliced URIs sequence for queue selection with optimistic state sync.
- [v0.4 Phase 5]: In-game HUD overlay with `pointerEvents: "none"` and discrete event polling.
- [v0.5 Roadmap]: Audio ducking must be 100% local via PipeWire `pactl set-sink-input-volume` (never Spotify Web API).
- [Phase 06]: Local PipeWire cosine volume fader with 50ms slices and single sink-input resolution.
- [Phase 06]: 3.0s exit debounce in Steam GamepadUI to eliminate child-launcher flapping.
- [Phase 06]: QAM volume slider displays elevated green DUCKED badge and live effective volume.
- [Phase 06]: VoiceActivityDetector monitors pactl source-outputs with 1.2s silence hold hysteresis window.
- [Phase 06]: Interactive Smooth Audio Ducking Engine card in SettingsTab with attenuation mode and duration pills.
