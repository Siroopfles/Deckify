## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v0.4 Phase 1]: Decoupled monoliths into `src/components/tabs/` and `py_modules/` submodules.
- [v0.4 Phase 2]: Concurrency-throttled base64 image queue with LRU cache bypassing Steam CEF CSP.
- [v0.4 Phase 3]: Monotonic clock ticker (`usePlaybackClock`) with drift gating and post-seek suppression.
- [v0.4 Phase 4]: Sliced URIs sequence for queue selection with optimistic state sync.
- [v0.4 Phase 5]: In-game HUD overlay with `pointerEvents: "none"` and discrete event polling.
- [v0.5 Roadmap]: Audio ducking must be 100% local via PipeWire `pactl set-sink-input-volume` (never Spotify Web API).
